# Unix-Final-Project
Packaging a Python Script to Debian

The purpose of this project is to automatically change the MAC address of your system using a Python script. However, we need to convert the Python script so we can run it on Debian. To do that, we will package the MAC address changer script to a .deb file.

### Step by Step Guide
**Step 1-**

First, we will need to make the working directories where we will store our:
- Root directory
- Python Script

We will also make .py files to import our directory as a package and to hold our MAC change logic.
